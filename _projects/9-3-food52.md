This project revolved around launching a print edition magazine for an online editorial brand, Food 52. In doing so we covered the entire process of magazine design, starting with research on the brand and itâ€™s direct competitors, then creating mood boards, then designing the magazine. The sections designed included the cover, table of contents, front of book navigation and articles, and feature well.
