Techtannica is a Rails based application that allows users to create public or private wikis (based on membership credentials). If a standard user wishes to create private wikis and allow for collaboration with other users, there is an option to upgrade for a small fee (through stripe).

This application deepened my knowledge of user authentication (with devise gem) and authorization (with the pundit gem). I also gained a stronger understanding of Active Record and data manipulation through querying.
