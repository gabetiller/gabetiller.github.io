After completing Bloc Jams with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I refactored the application with AngularJS. Since Bloc Jams structure lent itself to a single page architecture, Angular JS was an ideal SPA to build on. AngularJS was my introduction to Javascript frameworks and opened my eyes to how powerful a tool a framework is in building a dynamic, sophisticated web application.

I started by bootstrapping Angular to Bloc Jams. I then configured the routing and states of the application. Since Bloc Jams is an ideal app for Angular JS's single page I then used controllers to control the flow of data and refactor the code to be more modularized by creating templates for the different states. A crucial "ahhh" moment in my coding journey was the understanding of the concept of declarative vs. imperative view manipulation. Since "The Angular Way" is based around the concept that views are open books which "declare" the functionality by using HTML (contrasting the jQuery way in which much of the html elements have hidden functionality which lives in the JavaScript), it was helpful for me to see the clear relationship between the javaScript functionality and the forward facing HTML.

I used several Angular service recipes to share data and behavior across several components. Along the way I used a git repository to store my work. You can view the project here.
