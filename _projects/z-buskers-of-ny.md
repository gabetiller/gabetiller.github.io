For fun, I started an instagram account that explored the role of street musicians in urban culture. By the end of the semester it had gathered a substantial following, prompting me to design a zine/map which features interviews and photographs of my favorite street musicians. The printed zine of the instagram feed creates an interesting commentary on the juxtaposition between seeing something live, viewing it almost live via social media, and viewing it after the fact by way of print. The map shows where a particular artist is found in the subway, and at what time.
