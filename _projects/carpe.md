Package Design  
Winter, 2018

Carpe is a foot and hand anti-perspirant lotion founded in Durham, NC. Their products are now sold in stores across the country, including Harris Teeter.

After the initial briefing, it was clear that the goal was to win at retail with engaging packaging graphics that communicate efficacy and premium, while showcasing the clinical nature of the product.

A simple typographic solution with limited color palette and modern aesthetic, in combination with printing techniques were a perfect way to showcase the product as premium, effective and clinical.
