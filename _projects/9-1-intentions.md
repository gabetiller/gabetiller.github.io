Intentions is a luxury hair salon located in Cary, NC. The design was informed by the clients space, the studios philosophy, and the owners dedication to her craft. All products are ethically sourced and all business decisions are done with purpose. The logo type, website and overall identity utilize a minimal, soft green and black color palette, contemporary sans serif typeface, recycled materials and gridded precision, all of which are in line with the ownerâ€™s philoshopy, craft, and vision.
