In the summer of 2017 I developed a digital music player called Bloc Jams, which has similar functionality as Spotify. This project was the first frontend web development project in the Bloc curriculum and gave me a solid conceptual foundation to develop and deploy a responsive frontend web application.

I started developing the application's backbone and layout with HTML, then added style and responsiveness with CSS, and implemented interactivity and user experience with JavaScript. While developing the application I learned DOM
scripting, JQuery, expanded my ability to design responsive web pages and dynamic grid layouts using media queries and gained crucial experience with general workflow by using the command line and Git.

Bloc Jams culminated and pushed my problem solving and coding experience thus far while giving me a greater understanding of how different pieces of a web application fit together.
