Kele is a Ruby Gem that allows users to access Bloc's REST API. Developed in the winter of 2017, I aimed at creating a gem that accessed the Bloc's API in order to deepen my understanding of gems, API clients, data manipulation (including JSON data), and not to be forgotten, to become more dangerous with ruby in real world scenario.
