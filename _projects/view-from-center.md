This is a book cover design for The View From The Center of The Universe. Described as
“a science-based cosmology that allows us to understand the universe as a whole and our extraordinary place in it”, a simple typographic solution seemed  tting for such a mind bending, extraordinarily complex subject. The Type is sliced in the shape of Copernicus’s drawing of the solar system.
