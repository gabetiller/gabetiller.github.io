Poster for the Charles Mingus Jazz Festival. A typographic solution for the legendary bass playerâ€™s festival seemed appropriate. The type is arranged in the shape of a bass (left), with strings holding it together. Some of the elements considered were tension, rhythm, texture, balance, space, and movement.
