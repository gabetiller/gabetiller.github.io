Re-brand of Bagwell & Bagwell: Raleigh, NC’s oldest independent insurance agency. The agency wanted a new identity system which paid homage to it’s rich history but better reflected it’s pledge to look towards the future.  The logo mark, color palette and type selection were all chosen to evoke a sense of security, trust and strength.
