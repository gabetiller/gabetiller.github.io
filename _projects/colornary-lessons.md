This experimental cookbook is based around culinary fine art. Each chapter in this book starts out with a basic color theory lesson. Within the chapter, the artwork and the recipes relate to this lesson in some form or another. For example, chapter oneâ€™s lesson is primary colors. Each piece of art within the chapter will have a color palette based around one or more primary colors and the recipes have a correlation to that lesson as well.
