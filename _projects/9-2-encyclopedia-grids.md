11 x 17 in
Risograph Prints,
series of 100

In Sara Cwynar’s Encyclopedia Grid Series, similar but distinct photographs of a single subject are organized within a grid. Cwynar’s grids were the basis for the design of the invitation and other elements for the event. Cwynar approaches much of her work with
a playful experimentation, and the invitation, envelope and space illustrates this quality.

By unfolding the invitation, the recipient recieves pieces of information about the exhibition. The last piece is the name of the event which is a 10x14 inch poster.
